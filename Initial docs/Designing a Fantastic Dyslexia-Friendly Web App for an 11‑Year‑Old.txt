# Designing a Fantastic Dyslexia-Friendly Web App for an 11-Year-Old (Markdown Edition)

## Purpose & Audience

* **Primary user:** 11-year-old dyslexic beginner/intermediate typist who loves animals and humorous, Grimm-style (friendly) stories.
* **Secondary user:** Parent/carer who wants safety, visibility, and no accounts.
* **Core goal:** Make copy-typing feel like playful reading practice; build **accuracy and confidence first**, then gently introduce speed (optional timing).

---

## Design Principles

1. **Approachable first-run:** zero configuration, one big “Start” action, instant success bias.
2. **Low cognitive load:** generous spacing, consistent layout, minimal chrome, no moving text.
3. **Dyslexia-friendly defaults:** larger text, increased line/letter spacing, off-white backgrounds, optional dyslexia-oriented font; avoid italics/underlines.
4. **Effort over speed:** praise accuracy and perseverance; speed is opt-in and personal (“beat your best”).
5. **Self-paced micro-scaffolding:** short passages (80–160 chars), bite-size word sets, explicit pattern focus.
6. **Kind, specific feedback:** highlight what to do next rather than what went wrong.
7. **No accounts, no tracking:** all data local; parent view is read-only; export JSON.

## Pedagogical Approach

* **Copy-typing ? familiarity:** reduce spelling burden while increasing exposure to correct forms (British spellings).
* **Accuracy before speed:** show accuracy and error cues; unlock speed metrics only after stable accuracy (e.g., =95% across recent sessions).
* **Phonics & morphology tagging:** group content by patterns (ea/ee, ough variants), prefixes/suffixes (-tion/-sion, -able/-ible).
* **Deliberate practice:** end-of-session “focus drills” target top weak keys/words/patterns in 45–60s bursts.
* **Chunked progression:** KS1 ? KS2 ? KS3 filters and themes (Animals, Silly Stories, Nature, Science snips, Myths).

---

## Content Strategy (UK, British spellings)

* **Key Stages:** KS1, KS2, KS3 filters affect wordlists, passage complexity, and reading level labels (Y1–Y9).
* **Passages:** 70–160 characters, animal-centric, lightly humorous, age-appropriate; flags for `caps/punct/numbers`.
* **Word Sets:** 4–16 words per set tuned to patterns or topics; quick wins.
* **Pattern Packs:** targeted lists (6–12 words) for drills (e.g., *-tion*, *ough* variants, silent letters, *-able/-ible*).
* **Custom text (optional):** parent paste box with basic profanity/length checks.

---

## Dyslexia-Friendly UI/UX

* **Typography:** sans-serif default; optional dyslexia-oriented font; base size 16–18px; line height 1.6–1.8; letter spacing +2–6%.
* **Colour/contrast:** off-white or pale cream backgrounds to reduce glare; dark text; accessible contrast in both light and dark themes.
* **Layout:** single primary action per view; 60–70ch line length; never justify; no hyphenation; large hit targets (=44px).
* **Error display:** soft wavy underline for mismatches; green tint for matches; no flashing or punitive cues.
* **Focus aids:** focus-line mode (soft highlight on current line), optional on-screen keyboard hint with colour-zoned finger areas.
* **Motion:** limited, gentle (=150ms). Respect “reduce motion” OS preference.

---

## Keeping It Fun (Without Pressure)

* **Mascot companion:** subtle reactions only; no noisy animations.
* **Visual progress worlds:** sessions “light up” parts of a scene (effort-driven, not speed-driven).
* **Badges:** effort and habit focused (e.g., “Steady 95”, “Routine”, “Punctuation Pro”, “Explorer”).
* **Themes & choice:** child picks Animals/Silly Stories/Nature/etc. to feel agency.
* **Short bursts:** main sessions 2–3 min; optional 45–60s mini-drills.
* **Optional timer:** hidden by default; when enabled, it’s gentle, never punitive, and purely personal best tracking.

---

## Core Feature Set (Complete)

* **Copy-typing workspace:** target text above; input below; real-time per-char matching; optional lockstep (must match next char).
* **Next-key bubble:** large glyph (e.g., `;`, `? Space`, `? Enter`) with simple finger hint.
* **Mini-metrics (max 4 on screen):** Accuracy %, Errors, Time (if enabled), Net WPM (only when accuracy mastery achieved or timer chosen).
* **Lesson Picker:** tabs for *Words*, *Passages*, *Focus Drills*; filters for Stage/Theme/Complexity; snippet previews.
* **Session Summary:** celebratory headline; accuracy dial; (net) WPM if eligible; duration; errors; top 3 hardest keys; top 3 tricky words; actionable drill suggestion.
* **Focus Drills:** Keys (most-errored characters), Words (recent misses), Pattern (inferred phonics/suffix set).
* **Parent Glance (local):** this week (sessions, minutes, best/avg accuracy, trend); last 20 sessions table; export JSON; clear data; optional PIN.
* **Settings:** readability (font, spacing, background, dark mode), behaviour (lockstep/timer/hints), content defaults (Stage/Theme), privacy (PIN, clear).

## Session Flow

1. **Home ? Start (2 min):** auto-recommended content (Stage/Theme defaults).
2. **Typing:** copy-type with live feedback; lockstep optional; timer optional; next-key bubble visible.
3. **Completion:** on exact match (transformed by complexity flags), compute metrics and recommendations.
4. **Summary:** praise + one specific tip + one-tap drill (keys/words/pattern).
5. **Return to Home** or continue with drill/new story.

---

## Metrics & Logic

* **Correct characters:** positions where `typed[i] === target[i]`.
* **Accuracy %:** `round(100 * correct / typed.length)`; show 100% until first keystroke.
* **Gross WPM:** `(typed.length / 5) / minutes`.
* **Net WPM:** `Gross * Accuracy%`; **hidden** until accuracy mastery or timer enabled.
* **Errors:** lockstep: blocked mismatches; non-lockstep: mismatched positions at end.
* **Hardest keys:** top 3 target characters most involved in mismatches.
* **Tricky words:** words containing mismatches; normalised (letters/apostrophes).
* **Adaptive suggestions:**

  * If accuracy < 90%: suggest shorter/less complex variant (lowercase/no punct).
  * If accuracy = 95% in current and =2 of last 3: allow net WPM and offer speed mode.
  * If repeated pattern (e.g., *-tion*) across last 3 sessions: surface pattern drill.

## Data Model (Embedded; all British)

* **Word Sets:** `{ id, stage, theme, name, words[], tags{ phonics[], morphology[], complexity{caps,punct,numbers} }, meta{ est_chars, reading_level, notes } }`
* **Passages:** `{ id, stage, theme, title, text, tags{ phonics[], morphology[], complexity{} }, meta{ est_chars, reading_level, humour } }`
* **Pattern Packs:** `{ id, stage, theme, name, items[], tags{ phonics[], complexity{} }, meta{ est_chars, notes } }`
* **Transform rules (runtime):** lower-casing, punctuation removal, number stripping based on toggles; collapse multiple spaces; trim.
* **Keyboard hints map:** key ? friendly name + hand/finger.

---

## Storage, Privacy, Offline

* **Local only (`localStorage`):** settings, progress (minutes, badges), sessions (append-only, prune oldest beyond 500).
* **Export:** JSON bundle (settings/progress/sessions) for parent backup; no PII by default.
* **PIN (optional):** to gate Parent Glance and destructive actions (store a simple hash).
* **Offline:** single-file app works once loaded; no external fetch; inline SVG only.

---

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

* **Keyboard accessible UI;** visible focus rings; ARIA live region for feedback.
* **Contrast AA+;** dark/light/cream modes; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
* **No italics/underlines;** use bold/colour for emphasis; avoid justified text.
* **Optional focus-line highlight** and on-screen keyboard hints for spatial mapping.

---

## Copy Tone (Examples)

* Encouragement: “Nice and steady.” / “Great focus.” / “Calm and careful.” / “Brilliant effort!”
* Suggestions: “Fancy a 60-second *-tion* drill?”
* Summary praise: “Lovely typing!”

---

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Speed chasing:** gate WPM behind accuracy mastery; frame speed as optional personal bests.
* **Frustration with lockstep:** default on but clearly toggleable; explain benefits.
* **Overwhelm:** tight scope per screen; surface only 3–4 metrics max.
* **Reading level mismatches:** Stage filters + preview snippets; keep passages short; humour/light tone.

---

## Implementation Notes (non-binding)

* **Single-file architecture:** embedded CSS, JS modules (or IIFEs) and JSON datasets in `<script type="application/json">` blocks.
* **Rendering:** batch DOM writes; avoid layout thrash; clamp lines/width for readability.
* **Performance:** under 16ms input-to-paint; no heavy media; limit animations.
* **Extensibility:** datasets are append-only; deterministic adaptive rules; no opaque ML.

---

## Acceptance Checklist

* Runs offline, single HTML file, no external requests.
