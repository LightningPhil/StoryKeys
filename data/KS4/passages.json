    "text": "In a well-crafted sonnet, the interplay of consonance and dissonance enhances both rhythm and tone. The poet’s manipulation of sound patterns creates resonance that mirrors emotional tension, allowing the structure itself to echo the poem’s inner conflict. This auditory texture gives the reader a sensory route into meaning, reinforcing thematic unity through sonic craft.",
